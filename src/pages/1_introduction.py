    The Gambler's Ruin problem is a classic probability theory problem that studies 
    a gambler who starts with an initial fortune and plays a fair game against 
    an opponent (usually a casino) with infinite resources. The gambler's goal is 
    to reach a certain target fortune, but they risk going bankrupt in the process.

    Key concepts:
    1. Initial fortune (n): The amount of money the gambler starts with
    2. Target fortune (N): The amount the gambler aims to reach
    3. Win probability (p): The probability of winning each bet
    4. Loss probability (q = 1-p): The probability of losing each bet
